# MobilityModels
Graphical representation of mobility models in Python. This project was a part of the assignment for the course 'Analysis, Modeling and Simulation of Communication Networks' (EI7450) at Technical University of Munich.

## Motivation
Wireless network simulations often involve movements of entities like,
 *  Users are roaming on WLAN access points that are installed in buildings
(infrastructure mode).
 *  Cell phone users are walking a city.
 *  Cars using car-to-car communication.
 *  Ad hoc networks in emergency situations, e.g., earthquake or fire.

Mobility of entities plays an important role in such scenarios. Results may vary significantly if the mobility pattern is changed.

## Types of Mobility Models
Random
 * The study of system behavior by varying parameters.

Deterministic (based on real measurements)
 * Limited number of traces.
 
Combination of Random and Deterministic
 * A part of the model is deterministic while rest of the model is random.
